### /api/method/quickfix.api.get_job_summary

When a browser requests /api/method/quickfix.api.get_job_summary,
Frappe treats it as a call to a whitelisted Python method.

The request travels through Nginx → Gunicorn → WSGI → Frappe.

Frappe parses the dotted path quickfix.api.get_job_summary,
imports the module quickfix/api.py, and calls the function
get_job_summary() if it is decorated with @frappe.whitelist().

The function executes and returns data as a JSON response to the browser.

### /api/resource/Job Card/JC-2024-0001

This request uses Frappe’s automatic REST API for DocTypes.

Instead of calling a custom Python function, Frappe directly loads
the document of type "Job Card" with the name JC-2024-0001 from the
database.

The request is processed by the built-in resource handler, which
performs permission checks before returning the document data.

If the user does not have permission, an error is returned instead
of the data.


### /track-job

This request is handled as a website route instead of an API call.

Frappe checks the www folder of installed apps for a file matching
the route name. If a file such as track-job.py or track-job.html
exists, it is used to render the page.

The Python file defines the context data, and the HTML file defines
the layout of the page.

If no matching file or route is found, Frappe returns a 404 error.

## Step 2 — Session & CSRF

### CSRF Token

The X-Frappe-CSRF-Token is generated by the server and associated
with the user session when the user logs in.

It is included in POST requests to protect against Cross-Site Request
Forgery attacks. This ensures that requests are coming from the
authenticated user’s browser.

If the token is missing or invalid, Frappe rejects the request with a
403 Forbidden error.

### frappe.session.data

In the bench console, frappe.session.data returned an empty
dictionary because the console does not simulate a full web
request or browser session.

However, frappe.session shows basic session information such as
the current user and session ID.

This object represents the server-side session and is used by
Frappe to track authentication, user identity, and permissions
during requests.
